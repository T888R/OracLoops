# OracLoops
An upgrade of Berryloops with some extra features

The patch functions in the same way as Berryloops by WyrdAl with C, C#, D, D# starting 4 loops and E being a global start. 
F, F#, G, G# stop the respective loops and A is a global stop.

There are two versions that are provided. The normal oracloops which is designed for the OG Organelle and oracloops+ which utilizes the multiple cores for the M.
I have found there is signifcant improvements when using the plus version.

If errors are encountered be sure to make sure there is a folder at sdcard/media/oracloops or usbdrive/media/oracloops
Unzip folder to sdcard/media/orac/usermodules/sampler (or whatever folder you wish) or usbdrive/media/oracloops
