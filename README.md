# OracLoops
An upgrade of Berryloops by WydrAl with some extra features such as selecting start and end points, trigger, loop, and ping pong modes for playing back samples, attack envelope, plus all the functionality of the original. It is a bit menu divey so apologies for that.

The patch functions with the bottom C, C#, D, and D# able to start 4 loops with E being a global start. 
The bottom F, F#, G, G# stop the respective loops and A is a global stop.

There are two versions that are provided. The normal oracloops is designed for the OG Organelle and oracloops+ utilizes multiple cores for the M.
I have found there are significant cpu advantages when using the + version so I highly recommend using that version where possible. 

Make sure to have the appropriate folders created to house the samples at sdcard/media/oracloops or usbdrive/media/oracloops
Unzip folder to the orac usermodules folder and have fun!
